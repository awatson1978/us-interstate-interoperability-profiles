MA, NY, NJ, IL, OR, WA, CA, DE, NH, MD, MN, CO, NM (New Mexico may end up taking over the Arizona IVF market...this is my prediction. Arizona has been the IVF version of Silicon Valley--but the leadership there are pushing embryo personhood. So I am trying to sway people from Arizona even though there is this hub for IVF. I am expecting Arizona providers to move to New Mexico) Delaware and New Hampshire arent really known for having strong IVF options, but those would be safe states. 

OR, CO, and NM are the three best...

Also worth noting Oregon has death with dignity assisted suicide for residents and 'death tourism' 

No restrictions of any kind on terminations in CO, OR, or NM. Late term terminations are allowed in other states with ethics committee approvals.
